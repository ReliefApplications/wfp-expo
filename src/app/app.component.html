            “People by Jerry”
                2018
                On 7 February 2018 a magnitude 7,5 earthquake affected over half a
                million people in Papua New Guinea.
                When organizing food distributions in the Southern Highlands, WFP
                asked the local councellors in Pau’a for lists of people who should
                receive assistance. Jerry immediately took what paper and pen he had
                available and walked through the area counting people and drawing
                circles. The next day he handed WFP colleagues multiple sheets of
                paper covered with circles on both sides.
                WFP distributed high energy biscuits, rice and canned tuna to 1140
                people in Pau’a.
                Other lists - not Jerry’s - were used for the distributions.
                
                These 5 linocuts are freely inspired copies of Jerry’s work that Mairi
                Sun showed me on her return from Papua New Guinea after she took part
                in WFP’s response in the southern Highlands. They are a metaphor for
                the challenge of identifying, counting and representing people in need
                of assistance.
